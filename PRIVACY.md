# Privacy Policy for iClicker Poll Notifier

**Last updated:** January 29, 2025

## Overview

iClicker Poll Notifier is a browser extension that notifies you when iClicker polls start. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about what data we collect.

## What We Collect

### If you only use desktop notifications (default)
- **Nothing.** All poll detection happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to any server.

### If you enable Telegram notifications (optional)
When you choose to enable phone notifications via Telegram, we collect and store:
- **Telegram Chat ID** — A numeric identifier that allows us to send you notifications
- **Course/Activity IDs** — Anonymous identifiers from iClicker URLs used to coordinate notifications with classmates in the same session

## What We Do NOT Collect
- Your name, email, or personal information
- Your iClicker login credentials
- Your poll answers or grades
- Your browsing history
- Any content from the pages you visit

## How We Use Your Data

The data we collect is used solely to:
- Send you Telegram notifications when polls start
- Coordinate notifications with other users in the same class session

## Data Storage

- **Local storage:** Your preferences (sound on/off, notifications on/off) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API
- **Server storage:** If you enable Telegram, your Telegram Chat ID and session information are stored on Cloudflare Workers infrastructure

## Third-Party Services

If you enable Telegram notifications, your data passes through:
- **Cloudflare Workers** — Our backend server that processes notification requests
- **Telegram Bot API** — To deliver notifications to your phone

We do not share your data with any other third parties.

## Data Retention

- Session data (course/activity IDs) expires automatically after 6-10 hours of inactivity
- Telegram registration data is retained until you disconnect from the extension
- You can delete all your data at any time by clicking "Disconnect" in the extension popup

## Your Rights

You can:
- Use the extension without enabling Telegram (no data collected)
- Disconnect from Telegram at any time to delete your server-side data
- Uninstall the extension to remove all local data

## Children's Privacy

This extension is intended for college and university students. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date.
